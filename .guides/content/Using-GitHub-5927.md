In order to fully support collaboration on content, all Guides should be stored on GitHub.

## Pulling and Pushing
The key benefits of using Git for collaboration are 

- it allows any number of people to work on content independently. 
- it incorporates full version control

A key principle when collaboratively editing content is

- If more than one person is involved in editing content then commit your changes early and often.
- Do not wait for days until you push your changes, as this makes conflicts (which can be resolved of course) more likely.
